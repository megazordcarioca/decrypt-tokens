# decrypt-tokens [![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

A Go library for decrypting tokens from virtual wallets (e.g., ApplePay, GooglePay).

## üìñ Overview

### What is this library?

This Go library provides tools to decrypt tokens from virtual wallet payment systems, currently focusing on ApplePay decryption with plans to expand to GooglePay.

### Motivation

This project was born from the challenges faced while implementing Apple Pay token decryption in a professional environment. Existing JOSE libraries were outdated and incompatible with Apple's strict NIST SP 800-56A standard requirements. This implementation aims to simplify the process for developers working with payment token decryption in Go.

## üöÄ Features

- ApplePay token signature verification (EC-based)
  - ApplePay token decryption 


## üì¶ Installation

```bash 
go get github.com/megazordcarioca/decrypt-tokens
```

* <b>Apple Pay Module Guide

* <b>Google Pay Module (Coming Soon)

## üìù TODO List

  - ApplePay
    - [ ] Add RSA decryption support for Apple Pay
    - [ ] Optimize certificate verification redundancy
    - [ ] Refactor Apple Pay module
  - Google Pay
    - [ ] Implement Google Pay module
